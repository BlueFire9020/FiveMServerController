# How to Use

**It's Quite Easy, Actually**

The only thing you really need to know is that the path for each server needs to be the one containing the .bat file used to start your server. If you don't have one of those then I'd recommend making one, this program uses them to start the server as of right now. At some point I may add the option to start the server without a .bat file but currently they are required for full functionality.
